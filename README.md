# Malicious URL Detection Using Random Forest
## Project Overview
This project involves building a lightweight and transparent machine learning model from scratch to detect malicious URLs such as phishing, malware, and defacement links. It uses only lexical features and WHOIS-based metadata, making it suitable for real-time, scalable applications like email filters or browser extensions.
